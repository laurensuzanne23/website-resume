Hi there! I’m a senior at Stanford Online High School and, in addition to my love of academics, I have spent my high school experience pursuing a variety of artistic disciplines, including vocal performance, theater, visual art, and documentary filmmaking.

I’ve been performing in musical theater productions since I was seven years old, when I played Alice in a production of Alice in Wonderland. Since then, it’s been my main artistic passion, and I’ve supplemented performance with dedicated work on vocal performance and acting.

I also express my artistry through painting - usually oil paintings in the realism style, as well as an occasional ink and watercolor piece. In my work, I try to merge realism painting techniques with the magical aspects of the natural world, like the light sparkling on a calm ocean, or the rays of the sun shining through the crest of a wave.

My third major form of artistic expression has been my filmmaking. More particularly, writing and editing documentaries. This particular medium allows me to combine my artistic eye with my love of the humanities to discuss intellectual concepts in a visually enticing way. 

Samples from each of these three disciplines are featured below. I hope you enjoy my work!
